(Sorry about the website. I'll attempt to fix that sometime, maybe.)

This is just a small recipe database app I wrote in Perl/Tk because I
needed something to organize my own recipes, and existing applications
had way too many dependencies. Why would I want to install MySql just
to run a recipe database? Sometimes it's sad how out of touch the "geek"
culture is with the rest of the world.

My aim was simplicity and conciseness. The interface should be fairly
intuitive for anyone with experience using a GUI.

This code is BSD licensed. The details can be found in the LICENSE file.

REQUIREMENTS

perl 5 interpreter (tests fine w/ 5.6 and 5.8.)
Tk GUI toolkit (/usr/ports/x11-toolkits/tk8something in FreeBSD ports)
Tk module (/usr/portx/x11-toolkits/p5-Tk in the ports)
Tk::FileDialog module (/usr/ports/x11-toolkits/p5-Tk-FileDialog in the ports)
File::Basename (This should be installed by default.)
Getopt::Std (Ditto)

A GUI. This won't run in a console.

This should run on any platform that supports the requirements.

INSTALLATION

Simple:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test (optional)
make install (as root)

This will install both Rec::Recipe.pm and rec.pl.
rec.pl will be installed in /usr/local/bin by default.
Non-Unix users and anyone who doesn't like the default
can edit Makefile.PL and change the PREFIX line.

If you don't have make installed (shame on you!) do the following:

Copy rec.pl to a place in your path. Make sure it's executable.

Copy Recipe.pm to a place that will get included when you run perl.
You can set the PERL5LIB environment variable if you want to put
it somewhere else. I can't do much more here. I don't know how
your system is set up.

++++++++++

USE

Command line:

-h: Print somewhat helpful usage message
-f FILENAME: Open FILENAME (a cookbook file) when the program starts.

Alternately, you can set your REC_COOKBOOK environment variable to point
to the cookbook file you want to open on startup. Passing a filename on
the command line with the -f flag will override this, however.

If neither is specified, nothing is opened, the default save
path is ./cookbook.rec.

Searching through recipes is as simple as typing in a word or phrase
into the 'Search' entry, and hitting Enter or clicking the 'Search'
button. The 'Reset' button clears the search term and re-lists all
of your recipes.

+++

Buttons (with keyboard shortcuts):

New (Control-n): Create a new recipe
Edit (Control-e): Edit one or more selected recipes
Open (Control-o): Open a new cookbook
Save (Control-s): Save current cookbook
View (Control-v): View one or more recipes (like edit, but you can't
  change anything.)
Delete (Control-d OR the Delete key): Delete one or more recipes (It
prompts for confirmation. Don't worry.)
Quit (Control-q): Exit the program. Will prompt to save cookbook if
most recent changes have not been saved yet.

There are menu options that do the same thing as the buttons.

In the main window, you can click on more than one recipe at a time by
holding down the Control key while clicking recipes. Edit, View, and
Delete will work with multiple recipes selected.

You can also double click on a recipe to view it.

Pressing <Escape> will kill a viewing window, as if the 'Dismiss'
button had been pressed.

When searching for a recipe, pressing the 'Enter' key is the same
as clicking the 'Search' button.

BUGS

Probably some. If you want to file a bug report, feel free to do so.
Please include a problem description, the version of rec you're using,
the RCSID of the rec.pl file (There's a line near the top that says
my $RCSID = "$stuff$". I need that.) and any error messages spit
out by the interpreter.

Please send them to mpd@rochester.rr.com.

Feature requests can be sent to the same address.

++++++++++

ETC.

I consider this software done now. I'll still fix bugs as they arise,
and bug reports can be mailed to me as always, but at this stage, there
isn't really anything pressing that needs to be added. The software
does everything I wanted it to do now.
