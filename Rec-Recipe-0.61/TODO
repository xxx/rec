TODO

Features that I really want to add:
- Ability to print out recipes from the Viewing window (need to get
  a working printer first.)

Things I might add if I get bored:
- Ability to read and write other file formats, like RecipeML.
- Re-write to curses so I can use it from the console, like I
  REALLY want.
- Re-write to perl/Gtk. Gtk has far more widgets, all of which can
  do more stuff. I would probably just end up layering the code to
  be mostly GUI independent, as good software design says I should
  do in the first place.
- Add place to add any extra information about a recipe - comments, ideas...
